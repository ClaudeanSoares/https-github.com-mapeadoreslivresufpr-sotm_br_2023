This is a chance to ask the OSM Foundation Board questions, to engage with the board. Let’s have a conversation about the Foundation, the Board and how all the parts work together. If you know nothing about what the board is doing, this is a chance to find out. Find out what the Foundation does and doesn’t do, what it can and can’t do. Find out how you can help, how you can get involved. The Board is committed to openness and wants to engage with the community.
