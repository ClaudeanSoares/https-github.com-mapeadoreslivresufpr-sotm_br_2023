OpenStreetMap Foundation Board Ask Us Anything (i.e. AMA). We will take questions from the audience, or other questions that people can submit before the event, and we will talk about and answer them. We can talk about the past actions of the board, and what future plans we have.

<hr>

This is a chance to ask the OSM Foundation Board questions, to engage with the board. Let’s have a conversation about the Foundation, the Board and how all the parts work together. If you know nothing about what the board is doing, this is a chance to find out. Find out what the Foundation does and doesn’t do, what it can and can’t do. Find out how you can help, how you can get involved. The Board is committed to openness and wants to engage with the community.
