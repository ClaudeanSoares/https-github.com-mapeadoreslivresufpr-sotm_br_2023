We develop and test user embeddings approaches to vandalism detection in OSM. We successfully demonstrate improvements to previous vandalism detection methods, and additionally how the user embeddings can further be applied to detect different communities of mappers.  We validated the embedding model with a prepared vandalism corpus that we are also releasing to the OSM community.
