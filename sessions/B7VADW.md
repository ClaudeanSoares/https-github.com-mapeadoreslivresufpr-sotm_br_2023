Every day millions of users experience delightful features on Bing Maps. Each user, regardless of their technical background, possesses a wealth of local knowledge that can help improve map data which for many country regions comes from OpenStreetMap. The common OSM editorial tools iD &amp; JOSM are far too advanced for our users. Hence, we embarked on a mission to build a very simple tool - MapBuilder - that can guide users to volunteer their local knowledge to update map data via a set of guided screens. This talk will focus on the following: 
 - First features 
 - Building community engagement 
 - Identifying data gaps
 - Potential risks and mitigations
