MapComplete is an easy to use web editor, suitable for desktop and mobile. It can be seen as the spiritual offspring of both StreetComplete and MapContrib.

This workshop is a follow-up of my talk about MapComplete, and it aims to give an introduction in how you can create your own theme with MapComplete. In this format, you will be provided an introductory tutorial video and the necessary documentation which you should be able to follow along. I am standby in a video conference, so that questions can be asked live.

This workshop serves three goals:
- I want the community to learn how they can create and share there own thematic maps/editors
- I want to have some more, qualitative themes into MapComplete (and have some more contributors)
- I want to test and improve the documentation

If you want to join, you:
- will need to have made at least 500 changesets with your OpenStreetMap-account
- will need a thorough understanding of how tagging works in OpenStreetMap
- will need some knowledge on how to edit a .json-file
- will need to have access to a computer
- will need what MapComplete is, have tried it at least once. My other talk is a good introduction
