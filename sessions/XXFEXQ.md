The rise of organized editing practices in the OpenStreetMap community has outpaced research methods for identifying mappers participating in these efforts and evaluating their work. This research uses machine-learning to improve upon prior approaches to estimating corporate editing on OSM, contributing both a novel methodology as well as summary statistics that shed light on corporate editing behavior in OSM.
