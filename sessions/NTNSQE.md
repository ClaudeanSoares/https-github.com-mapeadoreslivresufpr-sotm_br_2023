OpenStreetMap (OSM) constitutes a new open geographic database and offers several possibilities of adding local knowledge. While the importance of local knowledge is largely acknowledged in the OSM community, relatively few scientific studies have evaluated them. This study presents a framework to measure local data contribution in OSM in three case studies. The results highlight a framework for measuring local data in OSM as well as the distinct mapping stories of local OSM communities.
