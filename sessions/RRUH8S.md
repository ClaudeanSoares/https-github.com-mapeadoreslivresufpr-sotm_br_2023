MapRoulette was first announced at State of the Map US in 2012 as a tool to solve the many errors introduced by the import of TIGER road data in the United States. Since then, MapRoulette has been used for map improvements and guided data imports around the world. In this talk, MapRoulette creator Martijn van Exel will look at some of the achievements, lessons learned, and the evolution from a single purpose tool to a micro-tasking platform.

[MapRoulette](https://maproulette.org), the open source web-based micro-tasking platform for OSM, was first announced at State of the Map US in 2012 as a tool to solve the many errors introduced by the [import of TIGER road data](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER) in the United States. After a successful and quick cleanup of over 60.000 common problems found in the TIGER data, it was clear that the idea of a micro-tasking tool was worth developing further. 

Over the years, MapRoulette gained a lot of functionality while staying true to its original goal: supplying the OSM communuty with quick, easy to solve tasks that help fix or improve the map. Nowadays, anyone can create tasks [using Overpass](https://learn.maproulette.org/documentation/using-overpass-to-create-challenges/#content) or GeoJSON, there are [new task types](https://learn.maproulette.org/documentation/creating-cooperative-challenges/#content) that make fixing problems in OSM even easier, and there is support for working in teams.

In this talk, MapRoulette creator Martijn van Exel will look at some of the accomplishments and lessons learned in 10 years of MapRoulette, and highlight some interesting uses of MapRoulette over the years. If time allows, he will also show some of the newer functionality that may not be as well known even to experienced users.
