OpenIndoor is an open source SaaS that uses OpenStreetMap indoor data to display a 3D graphical rendering of building interiors. The resulting map offers a gamified experience to meet different types of needs: indoor navigation, data representation, immersive tour etc.
We will discuss how we use the available open data and the Maplibre engine to address these different use cases.
