I am a professional data protection expert and a passionate long-term contributor to OSM.

For this talk, I want to combine both worlds and discuss:

0) How OSM already today is beneficial for the privacy of OSM consumers?
1) Which personal data is in the OSM public database (spoiler: behavioural 
data of contributors)?
3) Which potential privacy risks stem from the data for OSM contributors?
4) What are the GDPR compliance issues?
5) What is the outlook? I open the discussion (Q&amp;A) with some ideas to mitigate privacy risks. They involve likely changes to the current data governance, OSM database structure and OSM data itself.

Problems that are already evident that I plan to mention:
1) transparency on the processing of personal data of contributors
2) tracking of contributors, e.g. via
  - https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/oooc
  - https://overpass-turbo.eu/ with search &#34;user:username&#34;
  - https://hdyc.neis-one.org/?username
3) sharing of OSM data with third parties, see https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Registered_data_controllers

For the purpose of the discussion, I want to introduce the audience to a few core data protection concepts:
- purpose limitation
- data minimisation
- definition of personal data in the GDPR
- concept of anonymous and pseudonymous data
