_by Martijn van Exel_

Meet Your Mappers is an open source web-based tool that lets you discover who the local mappers are in your city or town. It will give you a list of local mappers that is organized based on their mapping activity: new mappers, heavy mappers, non-active mappers, et cetera. In this presentation, Martijn will explain how to use the tool, and how to create a complete flow to identify and contact local mappers using it.
