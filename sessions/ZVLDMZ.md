## The Meet Your Mappers Tool

_ by Martijn van Exel_

Meet Your Mappers is an open source web-based tool that lets you discover who the local mappers are in your city or town. It will give you a list of local mappers that is organized based on their mapping activity: new mappers, heavy mappers, non-active mappers, et cetera. In this presentation, Martijn will explain how to use the tool, and how to create a complete flow to identify and contact local mappers using it.

_by Beata Tautan-Jancso, Nicoleta Viregan_

Geohash is a plugin available in the JOSM tool, which comes to be handy for some of you who work in precise areas based on geohash units. The plugin displays a layer of grids on top of the map layer. In addition to the visualization feature, the plugin offers extra functionalities, and this talk aims to emphasize the diverse usages of this tool.

## A new tool for linking OpenStreetMap and Wikidata

_by Edward Betts_

Wikidata is a collaborative open data projects like OSM. It contains items that represent many of the same real world things that are described in OSM. I'm building a newer version of the matching software that is faster and more flexible. This software is available at https://osm.wikidata.link/
