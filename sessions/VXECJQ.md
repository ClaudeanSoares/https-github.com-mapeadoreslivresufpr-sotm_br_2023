OpenStreetMap consists of tagged nodes, ways and relations. Many use cases of geographic data, however, need a tabular dataset of points, lines and polygons. Processing OSM into derivative datasets is a crucial task that can benefit from new tools and formats. This talk will cover several topics around this theme, including:

* Existing approaches such as the Export Tool
* Why FlatGeobuf is a suitable forwards-thinking format
* Computational challenges for processing global-scale relations
* A new open-source program, Protoshapes, to generate admin polygons in FlatGeobuf format
* Efficient approaches for global datasets such as coastlines, oceans, and road connectivity
* Frequently updating datasets using the open-source OSM Express database
