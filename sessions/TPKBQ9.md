In a nutshell, MapaTanda seeks to improve both the quantity and quality of data in OpenStreetMap that is important and relevant to members of the older adult and ageing population (60 plus years old) in the Philippines.  This involves adding and cleaning features in OpenStreetMap such as nursing homes, hospitals that provide specialized care for the elderly, retirement homes, local offices for senior citizen affairs, community centers and other facilities that cater to or provide perks and services to older adults, etc. These data can then be used by local and national organizations for policy-making, planning, and implementing projects and interventions. 

SmartCT"s goal as an organization is to put citizens and data at the heart of developing smart cities and communities in the Philippines. We believe in an open, inclusive, holistic, and citizen-centric approach to building smart solutions. To do this, we partner with actors such as local government units to ensure that they have access to quality open data that they can utilize for planning their programs and services. We believe in the power of open data and consider OpenStreetMap as a great amplifier of that power. 

This talk will focus on community building and openness as foundations of age-friendly cities and communities. Our main goals for its talk are below:
1. Recruit new OSM volunteers 
2. Engage the older adult population to contribute in OSM 
3. build stronger relations with the local and global OSM community as well as foster partnerships with more local government units and national agencies.
4. call to institutionalize openness through policies
