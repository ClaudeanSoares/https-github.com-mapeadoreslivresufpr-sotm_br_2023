MapComplete is a newly created web editor which aims to be really easy to use. It tries to be just as simple as StreetComplete while offering per-topic views and presets just as MapContrib.

In this talk, I present the editor I've made. I will talk about the editor itself, how it grew in the past year and a half, some technical background and give some statistics on edits made with it and which themes proved to be interesting. I'll also touch upon the possibility to create your own theme (but I'll do an Q&amp;A-session specifically for that).

Furhtermore, a comparison with other editors in the OSM-ecosystem will be made and differences with StreetComplete and MapContrib will be highlighted, as those two editors were key in inspiring this editor - yet there are some important  differences with MapComplete in it's goals resulting in a fundamentally different approach and different use cases. I'll also zoom in on how the user journey is and how a few small features become available when the time is right for them to appear.

Finally, I will have a look to where MapComplete could be headed and which projects and technical innovations will be made in the future.

If you already want to try the editor, give it a shot at mapcomplete.osm.be
