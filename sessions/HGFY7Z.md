Boundary conflation is a sensitive and difficult problem to solve. When administrative boundary data is available from authoritative sources for OSM, it is imperative that we have the ability to analyze boundaries for import and deduce if conflation with OSM ways can be done hopefully in a semi-automatic fashion. &#34;Admin Boundary Conflation&#34; is a special-purpose tool made for the purpose and this talk will introduce the workings of the tool to the audience along with the various output statistics available during the process. Currently, the tool is utilized for reporting geometric area differences of 0.01% in the 99th percentile of 5000 municipalities in Serbia within 20 minutes.
