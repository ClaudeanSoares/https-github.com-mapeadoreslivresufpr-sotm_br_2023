This session will provide an introduction to the OpenStreetMap operations team, what OpenStreetMap.org services we are responsible for building and maintaining.

Grant recently became the OpenStreetMap Foundation's first full-time employee. Grant will present how he is helping improve reliability and security of the project's technology and infrastructure.

<hr>

Grant will detail how the Operations team are modernising the project's infrastructure by reducing complexity, paying-down [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt), while reducing the need to maintain [undifferentiated heavy lifting](https://www.factoftheday1.com/p/december-23-undifferentiated-heavy).

If youâ€™re interested in what powers OpenStreetMap and make it tick, come to this session.
