Researchers, cartographers, journalists or even &#34;just&#34; citizens have an interest in OpenStreetMap for a diverse range of purposes. While *using* maps and services based on OSM is easy, acquiring tailored geodata extracts to do research or to create custom visualisations can seem daunting at first.

Between loading a whole Planet file and tracing lines on a screenshot there is an offering of various - hopefully more suitable - other options. Well-known services like Geofabrik's Download Server are a great baseline, providing regional extracts and pre-processed Shapefiles. But other services and tools can provide even more useful approaches, e. g. through customisation by the user.

This talk aims to give an overview on available services (e. g. Overpass Turbo, various custom extraction services, osmdata.xyz) and tools (e. g. ogr2ogr, osmium and QGIS plugins like QuickOSM, OSMDownloader, OSMInfo), giving examples and highlighting their pros and cons, so interested users can find an suitable solution to satisfy *their* data needs.

Questions that will be touched on in the presentation:
- Which file/data formats are available?
- Is the data preprocessed and if so, how?
- What metadata is included?
- Which dimensions of the data can be selected or configured (spatial region, thematic filters, ...)?

A special focus will be on the usability of the solutions in the free and open-source desktop GIS application QGIS.
