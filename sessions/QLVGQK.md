Our proposed workshop aims to explore sound maps using OpenStreetMap data and free and open-source software (FOSS) through MANILAud: Metro Manila Soundscapes (http://bit.ly/manilaud; http://bit.ly/manilaudday)

MANILAud: Metro Manila Soundscapes is an interactive map that aims to help understand how people interpret sounds around them and the noise in their local area through soundscapes; to also help shape local noise policies and plans. Aside from this, it also wants to enable users to explore different areas in Metro Manila and somehow get the feeling of being there in that particular place despite the lockdowns and isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, through the semantic descriptions of the uploader, the soundscape attached to the location, and a photo related to the location.

In the workshop, we will be sharing about the project and also let the participants experience submitting soundscapes and hearing their soundscapes on the map.

Proposed Workshop Flow (in minutes):
01-15: Presentation about the Project (MANILAud: Mapping Soundscapes Through Participatory Data Collection - A case study of Metro Manila)
16-20: Workshop instructions for submitting soundscapes
21-35: Workshop proper: for participants to submit their soundscapes
36-45: (Participant's Break) to allow the team to add soundscape submissions on the map
45-55: Listening to the soundscapes on the map
56-60: Questions/Feedback from the participants
