I will not only talk about dealing with the village and river datasets but also with other import project in Taiwan, like Taichung address dataset import, schools, kindergarten, etc. And I will also have a short introduction of Taiwan community activities, both OpenStreetMap and Wikidata. Recently OpenStreetMap Taiwan got funded by Wikimedia Foundation to improve Taiwan mapping data and also Wikimedia related projects like Wikidata, Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiki Commons, etc.
