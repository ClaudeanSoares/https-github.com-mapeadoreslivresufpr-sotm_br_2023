This talk will feature a few members of the Local Chapters &amp; Communities Working Group for all different countries sharing how they are collaborating with their local state and federal governments.  Learn how OpenStreetMap is being used by governments all over the world! You will hear from OSM Belgium, OSM Italy, OSM US, OSM UK, OSM India, OSM Philippines, and more! We will share lessons learned, our ideas for how governments can better integrate with OSM, and success stories from around the globe. We intend to include as many speakers as we can fit into our slated time slot to share experiences from a diversity of places. Are governments mapping road in OSM? Importing buildings? Adding addresses? Or maybe comparing data in OSM to keep their data base current? Our working group can pre-record as needed. We hope to inspire other mappers to advocate for OSM in their local communities and even with their federal governments. 

Wow, this 200 word count minimum is very difficult to complete to describe such a simple concept. I hope that the planning for State of the Map is going well this year and that you are all doing wonderfully. Thank you for your work!
