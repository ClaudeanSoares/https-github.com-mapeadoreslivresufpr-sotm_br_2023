Grab"s journey with OSM started in 2015, with road geometry being the one mostly used to calculate ETAs and routing. Based on this use case, we enhanced OSM data using GPS probe based detections and satellite imagery. After the success we saw with the ETA and routing quality that OSM map could achieve in Singapore, we started dabbling with the idea of piloting Navigation quality maps for Singapore on OSM. 

Our journey on this started with researching the local traffic rules, signboards and restrictions that are relevant for Navigation. As Singapore is one of the countries in SEA which is well marked with all signs in SEA, we then moved on to solve the next level of challenge which is adding street level imagery across the country with the help of different cameras we could lay our hands on for the pilots. At times we used mobile phones with Karta View app and others we managed to add with better quality of Go-Pro like cameras. Few interesting learnings along the way; Rain can play a spoilsport to your plans last minute; Government, building authorities take time to give you permits for collecting imagery and you will need to plan those into your collection efforts; Roadworks, Road closures, congestion do not let you to cover all streets fully. Despite all these, sometimes you will not get permissions, Eg: Private condos. For such situations, tap into community to help add more imagery or data. 

Interesting learnings while mapping Singapore: Tunnels, Underpasses, etc. criss cross on multiple levels. Often times mappers get confused, despite availability of imagery. Road name abbreviations are sometimes not standardised and will have inconsistency when showing on maps and needs to be made consistent.
 
A map is never perfect, even for a well mapped country like Singapore as the physical world around you is changing. Instead of trying to be perfect, you can aim to be very agile and responsive making the real world changes reflect in the map data as close to realtime as you can get. What can help you in doing this well is working closely with local transport authorities (SLA, LTA, etc. in case of SG); Other major realtors and establishments which run several malls, office buildings, tech parks, etc. And last but not the least - community. Both OSM community and our driver partner community helped us immensely here. 

The journey to making the map for Singapore was quite arduous and needed the continued support of OSM community mappers, driver partners, local map operations teams. Everyone constantly keeping the map updated and improved helped us get to be the most preferred navigation provider for Grab driver partners. We enagaged these communities through various activities such as Geo*Stars, mapathons with organisations such as GeoWorks and hosted in-house mapathons to enable understand and contribute to the amazing OpenStreetMap data.

For our driver partner community, we started off with a whatsapp group to gather feedback and then proceeded to an in-app collection mechanism to make this reporting of road updates, map changes, a lot more faster and seamless. This coupled with our on-ground map operations teams which run road tests of the navigation helped us ensure our map stays as updated as possible. Working closely with the community ensured that they also could see the impact they were making on the maps everyday. This made Grab Navigation the most preferred option as it empowered them to build it together with us. 

This journey doesn"t end here, and we will be working even more closely with the community across South East Asia as this is the best way to scale these efforts on building maps for everyone.
