## Our Top 10 Data Quality Aspects
_Samson Ngumenawe_

[HOT](https://www.hotosm.org/) works with a number of organizations and communities that generate data through different contribution mechanisms, including desktop digitization, data collection surveys and local knowledge experiences. Each of these mechanisms lead to different aspects and issues that affect the quality of data contributed to OSM. We are prioritizing on minimizing the impacts of the top 10 aspects on the list through a number of ways, including mapper outreach programs, training, and developing technical tools.

## Community Mapping Initiatives in Tanga
_Antidius Kawamala_

Promoting a data-driven decision making culture in Tanga under living lab initiative, we are complementing the global objective of OSM i.e. to create a free editable geographic database of the world by various mapping activities around the region. The initiative uses local member by building capacity on how to use OSM and contributing to it as well as University Students. These mappings have been putting the missing pieces of the community on the map and addressing challenges they face so far. The usage of GIS data as a tool for community as a decision-making data tool can help in timely action and on-time problem-solving.

## Mapping all the worlds open data.
_Christopher Brown_

A showcase of how at mapstack we are building on top of OSM to create an ecosystem that will host all of the worlds open data as free to use web maps.

## Route shields of the world in OpenStreetMap-Americana
_Clay Smalley_

[OpenStreetMap-Americana](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_Americana) is an alpha-stage OpenStreetMap renderer intended to resemble a North American road atlas. Despite the focus on the United States, OSM-Americana has had contributions from people all over the world interested in adding support for highway route shields of their home countries. See a showcase of these contributions, and find out how you can put your country on the map.

## Bad or Good OpenStreetMap, What and how do you map?
_Enock Seth Nyamador_

OpenStreetMap editing is all welcoming, diverse and very forgiving but this leading to issues. Many of these issues which should not be occurring in the first place but happens. This is a quick talk giving you the tip of what I have come across in my short term as an OSM Contributor and why we should follow best practices.

## OSGeoLive: Your Open Source Geospatial toolbox
_Enock Seth Nyamador_

[OSGeoLive](https://live.osgeo.org) is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual Machine based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed around. It provides pre-configured applications for a range of geospatial use cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation of data. It also contains sample datasets and documentation. OSGeoLive is an [OSGeo](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSGeo) project used in several workshops and cases at FOSS4Gs and around the world.

## AI4Mapping: Earth Observation Data for Rapid Map Generation and DRRM
_Neyzielle Ronnicque Cadiz_

The Remote Sensing and Data Science: DATOS Help Desk by the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology- Advanced Science and Technology Institute builds on initiatives on disaster mitigation by providing a help desk pre-, during, and post-disaster events. The team provides remote sensing and data science applications support to critical activities on disaster mitigation, analysis, and advice. The project developed the Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation (AI4EO) initiative to complement the DRRM efforts of mandated agencies in the Philippines with the goal of rapid map generation for disaster risk reduction and emergency response using earth observation and OpenStreetMap data.

## I Map Tallinn
_Ilya Zverev_

A video installation about Tallinn and Every Door editor.

## OSM checks and completeness estimations with Disaster Ninja
_Pavel Pashagin_

Disaster Ninja is an open-source tool that helps the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team search for unmapped areas when a disaster strikes. It can help to estimate the coverage of OSM data, and check if OSM data is up-to-date and consistent for population data.
