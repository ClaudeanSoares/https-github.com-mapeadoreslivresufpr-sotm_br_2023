### maplibre-rs: Cross-platform Map Rendering using Rust
_by Max Ammann_

Last year I had a lot of spare time and decided to kick-start a project which combines different areas of interest: Rust, 3D rendering, Geo data.
This project was adopted recently by the [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) project and is now known as [maplibre-rs](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-rs).

The maplibre-rs library is a proof of concept which showed me the complexity of mapping solutions. It takes a lot of steps until edits from OpenStreetMap contributors are finally rendered in consumer applications. With this talk I want to take listeners on a journey from drawing changes in the OpenStreetMap editor all the way until vectors are uploaded from memory to GPUs.

## Lightning talks

To be announced later.
