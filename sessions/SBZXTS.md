Goals:
- Introduce the project for utility pole/power line mapping in Sierra Leone
- demo how to capture Mapillary imagery
- walkthrough on how to use RapiD for adding utility poles and street lamps
- guided mapathon with focus on Sierra Leone and option to replicate anywhere the participant wants, such as their hometown

Logistics:

- projector screen
- classroom environment good for lecture + laptop work
- bring your own laptop + mobile phone
- access to wifi needed (we can try to hotspot via my phone)
- we will try to provide a few laptops, but if the venue can provide any it will be helpful for using OSM iD/RapiD
