Presentation of the work we've done to adapt the OSM Carto style to vector tiles. We will take you through the making-of the cartography, step by step, scale by scale.
Available on MapTiler Cloud (https://cloud.maptiler.com/maps/openstreetmap/), the style will be integrated into the next version of the OpenMapTiles project.

We will also show you how to use this style in QGIS and how to display it on 3D maps with MapLibre.
