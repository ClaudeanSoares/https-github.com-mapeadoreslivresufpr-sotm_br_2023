As an interactive, open-source, high-level programming language designed for data science, R is a great fit for dealing with OpenStreetMap data and introducing beginners to reproducible scientific computing. In this workshop, you will learn how you can use a variety of R packages that are ideal to:

* acquire relevant OSM data in a vector format
* clean and process the data
* display it in static and interactive visualisations
* share a visualisation with others
* export the data to other programs for further editing

Most data acquisition, cleaning, processing, visualising and exporting can be done writing an R script. For further refinement of an output, other point-and-click programs (like QGIS) might be required, but storing the bulk of the process in a script allows us to easily reapply the same process on an updated dataset, share the process with others so they can learn from it, and provide supporting evidence when publishing results.

Basic knowledge of R is preferred to follow along this workshop.
If you want to run the commands on your own computer and learn by doing, please install both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) prior to attending, as well as the necessary libraries for spatial data processing (see [OS-specific instructions](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/#installing)).
