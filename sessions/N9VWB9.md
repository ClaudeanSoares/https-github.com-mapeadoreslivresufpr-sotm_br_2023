For these projects, we used geographic data and open source technologies, especially OpenStreetMap, and based on a participatory approach by mobilizing and fully involving local communities. We also worked to promote cooperation between the different actors in the region. 
At this conference, we want to share our field experience and approaches to increase the production and availability of geographic data in the concerned regions and initiate new groups of local contributors to enhance and maintain the OpenStreetMap database.
