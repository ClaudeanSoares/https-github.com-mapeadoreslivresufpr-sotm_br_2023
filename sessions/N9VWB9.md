We would like to share our feedback on facilitating OSM participatory mapping workshops for climate change adaptation projects with OSM local communities 
Since 2015, CartONG has been expanding its work into the domain of participatory mapping, first by partnering with the international Missing Maps project, and then by working to develop a wider set of tools and methodologies. 
Over the last 12 months, we had the opportunity to support two climate change adaptation projects, one in Tajikistan for the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the other in Madagascar in the Morombe region for Secours Islamique France.

For these projects, we used geographic data and open source technologies, especially OpenStreetMap, and based on a participatory approach by mobilizing and fully involving local communities. We also worked to promote cooperation between the different actors in the region. 
At this conference, we want to share our field experience and approaches to increase the production and availability of geographic data in the concerned regions and initiate new groups of local contributors to enhance and maintain the OpenStreetMap database.
