Designing hyperlocal maps starts with understanding the users in their day-to-day journey through some user research method and why the current digital maps experience does not provide a complete experience for them to navigate and explore the neighborhood. This talk will provide the audience the insights into the mobility lifestyle of the local people in tier 2 cities and how the Grab Geo design team translates into a design for consumption.
