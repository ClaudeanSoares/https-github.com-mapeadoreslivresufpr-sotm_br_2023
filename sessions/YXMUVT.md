Designing hyperlocal maps starts with understanding the users in their day-to-day journey through some user research method and why the current digital maps experience does not provide a complete experience for them to navigate and explore the neighborhood. This talk will provide the audience the insights into the mobility lifestyle of the local people in tier 2 cities and how the GrabMaps design team translates into mobile app design to help improve the quality of life for our users. The designer will also share what are some of the key learnings when designing for Southeast Asia.
