Across OpenStreetMap there are ways to get involved from working groups to events to boards. How can we increase and deepen participation across the world? What is the current state of engagement/governance in OSM? What do we need to do to improve? What are some of the lessons from other open organizations?

<hr>

Proposed Outcomes
 
-Inspire people to join play a bigger role in OSM - working groups, boards, governance
-Engage a larger discussion about diversity, equity, and inclusion with a shared leadership approach 
-Infuse the OSM network with insights from other ‘open projects’ on their insights
 
Notes
We want to make this as accessible and inclusive as possible. Thus - calling it ‘governance’ won’t build participation. For years, there has been sessions on ‘working groups’ and ‘meet the board’ or meet ‘weeklyosm’. These are valuable, but we need to go wider and deeper. 
How can we learn about our shared network and build momentum in participation /engagement and leadership?
