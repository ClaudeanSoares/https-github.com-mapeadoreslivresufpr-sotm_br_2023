In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of setting up your own mapcomplete theme.

After a short introduction, explanation of some common pitfalls and a technical explanation, you're invited to open up your laptop (or tablet) and can try it out yourself while I'm around to answer some questions.

If you ever wondered how you can quickly create an OSM-editor geared towards a specific topic, this workshop is for you.

First, a small introduction to what a good theme is will be given; together with some common requests and best practices. Afterwards, the technicalities of getting started are explained. The idea is to have a hands-on workshop, where one can give it a try immediately.
