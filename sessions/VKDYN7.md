If you ever wondered how you can quickly create an OSM-editor geared towards a specific topic, this workshop is for you.

First, a small introduction to what a good theme is will be given; together with some common requests and best practices. Afterwards, the technicalities of getting started are explained. The idea is to have a hands-on workshop, where one can give it a try immediately.
