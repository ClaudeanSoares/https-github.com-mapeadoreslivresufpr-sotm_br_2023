Every day hundreds of people sign up for OpenStreetMap. We have several active OpenStreetMap communities, communities that are struggling to sustain themselves and at the same time,  there are countries with no existing OpenStreetMap communities despite having contributors from those countries. 
This idea of a community playbook is to act as a guide for persons interested in starting up an OSM community and sustaining OSM communities with  lessons drawn from existing communities.

The community playbook is based on 4 themes; Identifying local community issues, attracting and engaging students, Connecting contributors motivation to mapping and Training
