State of the Map US is a conference designed for everyone using and interested in OpenStreetMap. Our goal is to bring together the diverse universe of users that make up OpenStreetMap, and to make everyone feel welcome to participate, speak up, ask questions, and engage in the event, sessions, and conversations. The growing diversity of the OpenStreetMap community includes hobbyists and professionals, people of different ethnic backgrounds and gender identities, rich and poor, etc. This is the OpenStreetMap community, and we are all welcome and encouraged to come to State of the Map US.

To achieve this we require that everyone participating in State of the Map treat everyone at the event with respect and kindness, and acknowledge that people from different backgrounds have different understandings of what is offensive, derogatory, and unwelcoming, and commit to bridging this through positive communication.

To ensure that State of the Map US is a welcoming event, please do not:

-  Use offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion. Respect everyone who makes up OpenStreetMap.
- Use sexual images in public spaces, sessions, talks, or parties.
- Try to intimidate, bully, or talk over your fellow community members. Continually interrupting or talking over someone trying to participate in a session or conversation is not allowed.
- Have inappropriate physical contact or give unwelcome attention.


If you see, overhear, or experience any of this behavior, or anything that makes you feel unwelcome, immediately find a conference volunteer - that's anyone wearing a blue badge. We commit to listening to your complaint, discussing the behavior with everyone involved, and working to find a resolution. We reserve the right to expel from the conference without refund anyone violating our code of conduct.

Bottom line, be kind, respectful, and understanding of our community's diversity at all times. This is how we grow and improve our map - by engaging more people, from more backgrounds, to contribute - and we do this by welcoming them into our community.
