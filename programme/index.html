<!--<h2 id="overview">Programme</h2>-->

<p>State of the Map 2022 will take place from <b>19 to 21 August 2022</b> in Florence, Italy. We have created an exciting programme with youâ€”the OpenStreetMap community. For the duration of the conference, we have rooms set aside for breakout sessions that can be booked by groups of mutual interest, or used without prior planning.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#general_Friday">Friday, 19 August</a>: conference begins with an opening session, followed by a day of presentations and workshops</li>
  <li><a href="#general_Saturday">Saturday, 20 August</a>: day 2 of more presentations and workshops</li>
  <li><a href="#general_Sunday">Sunday, 21 August</a>: the final day continues with more talks and workshops plus a whole track of academic talks selected by our scientific committee</li>
</ul>

<p>The programme below is still in a preliminary state: talks might still be shifted around by the programme committee and some remaining talks as well as the details of the academic track will be added soon.</p>

<p>If you want to use an app to get reminders for talks in the schedule, you can use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gaast.giggity">Giggity</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="breakout">Self organized sessions</h3>
<p>
  Besides the main programme of SotM we offer space for self-organized sessions. A lot of topics are well placed in smaller rounds. The only requirement that we have to your topic is that it has to be related to OpenStreetMap. We use a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2022/self-organized_sessions">dedicated OSM wiki page</a> for the organization of such sessions so that everybody is able to jump in without any larger formal barrier. The only requirements we have is that the participants have a conference ticket which grants them access to the conference platform that we use and that they abide to the SotM Code of Conduct.
