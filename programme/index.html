  <h3 id="breakout">Self organized sessions</h3>
<p>
  Besides the main programme of SotM we offer space for self-organized sessions. A lot of topics are well placed in smaller rounds. The only requirement that we have to your topic is that it has to be related to OpenStreetMap. We use a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2022/self-organized_sessions">dedicated OSM wiki page</a> for the organization of such sessions so that everybody is able to jump in without any larger formal barrier. The only requirements we have is that the participants have a conference ticket which grants them access to the conference platform that we use and that they abide to the SotM Code of Conduct.
