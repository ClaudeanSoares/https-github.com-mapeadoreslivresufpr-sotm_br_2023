We are delighted to announce that State of the Map 2016 will be held in Brussels, Belgium. The conference will be in the third quarter (Jul-Aug-Sep) of 2016.

Thank you to all teams who submitted a proposal. The quality of the bids was fantastic and it was pleasure reviewing them.

We are currently working with the Brussels team to formalise the plans and will keep this website updated as we can share more. See you in 2016 in Brussels!
