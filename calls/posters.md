## Submit a poster today!

Our first virtual poster exhibition during SotM 2020 was a great  success. Thank you to everyone who participated. Building on this and  previous State of the Map culture, we love to hear and see what have  been done with OpenStreetMap, so we invite you to participate in our  poster exhibition for the virtual State of the Map 2021.

Your poster could show how well your home region is mapped, or it  could be a beautiful new style or map. It might focus on a community  project, academic research or statistics, or a poster explaining and  inviting people to OpenStreetMap. Everything about and related to OSM is  always welcome! For inspiration, see [SotM 2020 posters](https://2020.stateofthemap.org/posters/).
